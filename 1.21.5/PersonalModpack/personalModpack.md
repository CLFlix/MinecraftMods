# Personal Modpack

I don't really know if I can call this a modpack, but these are all the mods that I use currently in the game. Meaning: if I start using or delete a mod from my client, it will also get deleted from here.

## Appleskin

When you're hungry and you hold up food in your hand, you can see how much that specific food item will fill up your hunger bar. It will also show you the saturation it gives you. When you eat it, the saturation will be shown and will show you when it's decreasing.\
If you're damaged, this mod will also show you how much this food item will heal you.

## Freecam

With this mod, you can detach your camera from your player head, allowing you to go to a place, getting a look at it without moving your character there. It's essentially as if you would launch a drone in the air and fly it to the place you wanna look at.

## Iris

Compatible with Sodium. This mod allows you to use shaders! :D

## Litematica

Not having to constantly look at a photo, video or your own world to see how you built something in the past is a dream of us all. Litematica makes this dream come true, allowing you to save blueprints of an area and use the blueprint in another world. The mod will automatically calculate how many blocks of each block type you need and give you a list of it all.\
_This mod works together with MaLiLib. If you delete this mod, Litematica won't work._

## Mod Menu

This mod does exactly what it sounds like. This mod scans all your mods in the "mods" folder and simply shows you a list of all the mods you have installed. You can also go to the mod page via this mod menu to update the mod if there's a new version available.

## MouseTweaks

Ever had the feeling you wanted to have a quicker inventory management system with your mouse? Well, this mod provides you with all sorts of nice features for your mouse to use in the inventory, chests, crafting tables,... You can also choose to enable / disable each individual tweak.

### Tweaks

- You can hold your RMB to drag items in your inventory, mostly used in crafting tables. If you drag over a slot multiple times without releasing your RMB, you start stacking items into that slot according to how many times you've dragged over this slot.
- If you selected an item in your inventory / chest / ..., you can hold your LMB to pick up all the items of the same type.\
  For example: if you want to pick up all items of the same type in a chest like this:\
  ![Chest with sand and dirt](../../ignore/same_type_chest.png)\
  you simply hold your LMB and drag it over all the items of the same type.\
  ![Picking up all sand items from the chest](../../ignore/same_type_chest_pickup.png)
- Of course, we all know shift-clicking quickly moves the item you selected to your inventory. With this tweak, you can hold you shift key, hold your LMB and drag over all the items in a chest to move all of them quickly to your inventory, instead of having to click on each individual item slot.
- If you have an item stacked in your inventory / chest, you can use your scroll wheel to place items in the other inventory type. Scrolling down causes the item to be moved to the other inventory and scrolling up causes the items to be moved to the inventory where your mouse is at the point of scrolling. It also can be the other way around, if you customize the setting yourself.

## Skinlayers

To put it very simply: this mod makes player skins look like a 3D-model, instead of just a plane 2D image.

## Wavey Capes

This mod makes capes wave when you run / jump with physics, instead of being a hard cardboard piece attached to your neck.

## WI Zoom

With this mod, you can zoom in like the famous OptiFine zoom. While zooming in, you can use your scroll wheel to zoom in even further or zoom in less far.\

## Xaero's Minimap & Worldmap

These are two mods that you can use apart from each other or together! Both the minimap and the worldmap have a lot of different features and a lot of customization options. You can customize it until you get sick of looking at it or to get a calmer feeling of the minimap. The mods also feature waypoints which you can teleport to, so when you find a place for the first time, you don't always have to travel so many blocks anymore!
