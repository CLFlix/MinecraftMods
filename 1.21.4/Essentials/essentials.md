# Essentials

This folder includes the optimisation mods and some mods to enhance your experience in the form of a minimap / waypoints / voice chat.

## Iris

Compatible with Sodium. This mod allows you to use shaders! :D

## Mod Menu

This mod does exactly what it sounds like. This mod scans all your mods in the "mods" folder and simply shows you a list of all the mods you have installed. You can also go to the mod page via this mod menu to update the mod if there's a new version available.

## Voicechat

I don't think this needs much explanation ;) Just a simple voice chat mod to communicate with each other without any third-party software. This works with proximity chat and you can join group chats which allow you to communicate without being in each other's vicinity.

## WI Zoom

With this mod, you can zoom in like the famous OptiFine zoom. While zooming in, you can use your scroll wheel to zoom in even further or zoom in less far.\

## Xaero's Minimap & Worldmap

These are two mods that you can use apart from each other or together! Both the minimap and the worldmap have a lot of different features and a lot of customization options. You can customize it until you get sick of looking at it or to get a calmer feeling of the minimap. The mods also feature waypoints which you can teleport to, so when you find a place for the first time, you don't always have to travel so many blocks anymore!
